## Summary of the findings
In the exploration part, i realized there is a strong correalation between passengers class and chances of surviving. It was obseverved those passengers who aboarded first class survived more than those who were in second class, and those who were in second class had more survivors than the third class.
Another finding in my exploration was how gender survived. Females survived many compared to males 
In the titanic there was relationship between passengers class and their age. It was observed passengers aged 30-40 were the majority in first class, while those in their twenties aboarded third class.
