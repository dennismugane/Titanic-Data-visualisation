###  Titanic Data Visualization from Disaster
The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships.

One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.

In this cproject, I perform visualization to get the analysis of what sorts of people were likely to survive. In particular, I use univariate distribution, bivariate distribution and multivariate distribution and provide an explanatory notebook with key finds from the exploratory notebook
#### Structure of the dataset:
The dataset has 12 columns with 891 rows. Every entry represent a passenger's information regarding each feature. Those columns are:
Survived - Survival (0 = No; 1 = Yes)

Pclass - Passenger Class (1 = 1st; 2 = 2nd; 3 = 3rd)

Name - Name

Sex - Sex

Age - Age

SibSp - Number of Siblings/Spouses Aboard

Parch - Number of Parents/Children Aboard

Ticket - Ticket Number

Fare - Passenger Fare (British pound)

Cabin - Cabin

Embarked - Port of Embarkation (C = Cherbourg; Q = Queenstown; S = Southampton)
##### Summary of findings from the Exploratory section
Females survived more than males
Those in First class survived many compared to second class, and second class had more survivors than third class; 1 > 2 > 3
