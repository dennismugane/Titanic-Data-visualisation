# Titanic-Data-visualisation
Case study to see visually how different variables affected chances of survivor in titanic
## This dataset was downloaded from kaggle. It has 12 columns and 891 rows. For this project I used Jupyter notebook to perform every single analysis.
### I imported liabries like pandas, numpy, matplolib.pyplot, seaborn where i used them for data cleanining stage and performing project goal i.e visualization.
#### In the first phase of the project was exploring the features in the dataset and performed several tidiness issues before doing data visualization.
##### At this stage performed univariate distribution, followed by bivariate distribution, and lastly was multivariate distribution. different variables were used to explore how correlated they were with chances of a passenger surviving. One of the main findings was that the passengers class was factor determining survivor. Those in first class had the highest number of survivors. Interms of gender, male had the highest number of passengers who succumbed to the tragedy.
